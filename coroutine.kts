/**
 * Conceptually, async is just like launch. It starts a separate coroutine which is a
 * light-weight thread that works concurrently with all the other coroutines.
 * The difference is that launch returns a Job and does not carry any resulting value,
 * while async returns a Deferred â€” a light-weight non-blocking future that represents a
 * promise to provide a result later. You can use .await() on a deferred value to get
 * its eventual result, but Deferred is also a Job, so you can cancel it if needed.
